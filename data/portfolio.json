I'm Yu Gao, your friendly coding enthusiast üöÄ. With a Master's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I'm like a digital wizard on a quest for innovation üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\nThroughout my industry experience, I embarked on epic journeys filled with bug-battling and heroic coding endeavors. I thrived in collaboration with cross-functional teams and skillfully harnessed a multitude of frameworks.  I possess mastery over a diverse spectrum of languages and tools, including JS/TS, Java, and SQL, which is why Workday and SAP summoned me to their aid.\nI've been passionate about painting üé® since my elementary school days, and this artistic journey has sharpened my patience and creative skills. Beyond art, I bring this heightened sensitivity to detail into UI-related work. It's second nature for me to spot even the slightest 1px miss-position issue, ensuring a polished and perfect user interface. In addition, I'm a pet parent with two dogs üê∂ and two cats üê±, adding an extra layer of warmth and companionship to my days üêæ.","resume":{"tagline":"üë®‚Äçüíª  I'm a software developer (in most of time).","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
